/* Imagine youâ€™re playing a game with some friends and you
want to keep track of the score. Create an object called
scores. The keys will be the names of your friends, and the
values will be the scores (which will all start at 0). As the
players earn points, you must increase their scores. How
would you increase a playerâ€™s score in the scores object? */
